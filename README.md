# Another FFT

This is a Rust crate implementing the Fast Fourier Transform.
It's called _another_ FFT because there are already crates with great
FFT implementations. This one is more of a personal project for experimenting with the
various FFT implementations that are out there and some applications. Who knows, maybe
someday it will find some niche that isn't filled by existing libraries. Or maybe not,
and that's fine too.

It currently has the FFT implementation from

which the authors credit to N.M. Brenner.
